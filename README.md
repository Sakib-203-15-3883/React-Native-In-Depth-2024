1. Understanding the concepts of components in react native

      React Native uses react as a UI library and we know that react application is a tree of components where the root component 
      brings everything together. 

      i. React components : 

      It's a reusable piece of code that represents a small part of the user interface.  It's a JavaScript function that returns jsx 
      which is used to describe how the UI should look like.

      ii. React Native Components :

       React Native components are essential building blocks used to create user interfaces [ contents ] for mobile applications. 
       There are 3 types of react native components.

       i. Core Components :
   
             It's a pre-built UI component provided by react native . it,s platform independent,s , means it,s works for Android and 
             ios .  it,s highly customizable using props . 
              There are a few core components : 
              <View>, <Text>, <Image>, <ScrollView>, <TextInput>, etc.

      II. Native Components:
   
       UI elements that are specific to the platform. written in the respective platform's native language (Objective-C/Swift for iOS, 
       Java/Kotlin for Android).We can create custom native components and expose them to React Native using a process called bridging.

       Example of device-specific features :
       Camera Access, GPS and Location Services,Biometric Authentication, Device Sensors

      iii. Community components:

         
         Community components in React Native refer to third-party libraries or packages created and maintained by the developer 
         community.
         UI Components . [ react-native-elements, react-native-paper ]
         Navigation [ react-navigation ]
         State Management [ Redux ,  MobX ]
         Networking and APIs [ axios ,react-native-fetch-blob]
         Animations [ react-native-reanimated , lottie-react-native ]
         Maps and Location Services [ react-native-maps , react-native-geolocation-service ]
         Push Notifications  [ react-native-push-notification ]

     
#Any component that renders other components is a parent component. rendered components known as child components 
#Most of React Nativeâ€™s Core Components can be customized with props
